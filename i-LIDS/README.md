  >   abstract = {The increasing number of video surveillance cameras is challenging video control systems. Monitoring centers require tools to guide the process of supervision. Different video analysis methods have effectively met the main requirements from the industry of perimeter protection. High accuracy detection systems are able to process real time video on affordable hardware. However some problematic environments cause a massive number of false alerts. Many approaches in the literature do not consider this kind of environments while others use metrics that dilute their impact on results. An intelligent video solution for perimeter protection must select and show the cameras which are more likely witnessing a relevant event but systems based only on background modeling tend to give importance to problematic situations no matter if an intrusion is taking place or not. We propose to add a module based on machine learning and global features, bringing adaptability to the video surveillance solution, so that problematic situations can be recognized and given the right priority. Tests with thousands of hours of video show how good an intruder detector can perform but also how a simple fault in a camera can flood a monitoring center with alerts. The new proposal is able to learn and recognize events such that alerts from problematic environments can be properly handled.}

  >   ABSTRACT = {In recent times, we have seen a massive rise in vision-based applications, such as video anomaly detection, motion detection, object tracking, people counting, etc. Most of these tasks are well defined, with a clear idea of the goal, along with proper datasets and evaluation procedures. However, perimeter intrusion detection (PID), which is one of the major tasks in visual surveillance, still needs to be formally defined. A perimeter intrusion detection system (PIDS) aims to detect the presence of an unauthorized object in a protected outdoor site during a certain time. Existing works vaguely define a PIDS, and this has a direct impact on the evaluation of methods. In this paper, we mathematically define it. We review the existing methods, datasets and evaluation protocols based on this definition. Furthermore, we provide a suitable evaluation protocol for real-life application. Finally, we evaluate the existing systems on available datasets using different evaluation schemes and metrics.},
