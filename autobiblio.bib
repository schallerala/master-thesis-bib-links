    abstract={State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.},

    abstract={Traditional computer vision models are trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories. Recently, natural language has been shown to be a broader and richer source of supervision that provides finer descriptions to visual concepts than supervised "gold" labels. Previous works, such as CLIP, use a simple pretraining task of predicting the pairings between images and text captions. CLIP, however, is data hungry and requires more than 400M image text pairs for training. We propose a data-efficient contrastive distillation method that uses soft labels to learn from noisy image-text pairs. Our model transfers knowledge from pretrained image and sentence encoders and achieves strong performance with only 3M image text pairs, 133x smaller than CLIP. Our method exceeds the previous SoTA of general zero-shot learning on ImageNet 21k+1k by 73% relatively with a ResNet50 image encoder and DeCLUTR text encoder. We also beat CLIP by 10.5% relatively on zero-shot evaluation on Google Open Images (19,958 classes).},

    author={Kaiyang Zhou and Jingkang Yang and Chen Change Loy and Ziwei Liu},
    abstract={Large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown great potential in learning representations that are transferable across a wide range of downstream tasks. Different from the traditional representation learning that is based mostly on discretized labels, vision-language pre-training aligns images and texts in a common feature space, which allows zero-shot transfer to a downstream task via prompting, i.e., classification weights are synthesized from natural language describing classes of interest. In this work, we show that a major challenge for deploying such models in practice is prompt engineering, which requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming -- one needs to spend a significant amount of time on words tuning since a slight change in wording could have a huge impact on performance. Inspired by recent advances in prompt learning research in natural language processing (NLP), we propose Context Optimization (CoOp), a simple approach specifically for adapting CLIP-like vision-language models for downstream image recognition. Concretely, CoOp models a prompt's context words with learnable vectors while the entire pre-trained parameters are kept fixed. To handle different image recognition tasks, we provide two implementations of CoOp: unified context and class-specific context. Through extensive experiments on 11 datasets, we demonstrate that CoOp requires as few as one or two shots to beat hand-crafted prompts with a decent margin and is able to gain significant improvements over prompt engineering with more shots, e.g., with 16 shots the average gain is around 15% (with the highest reaching over 45%). Despite being a learning-based approach, CoOp achieves superb domain generalization performance compared with the zero-shot model using hand-crafted prompts.},

    abstract={With the rise of powerful pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, it becomes essential to investigate ways to adapt these models to downstream datasets. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp) introduces the concept of prompt learning -- a recent trend in NLP -- to the vision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, CoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with only a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over intensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem of CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed during training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight neural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector). Compared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance and are thus less sensitive to class shift. Extensive experiments show that CoCoOp generalizes much better than CoOp to unseen classes, even showing promising transferability beyond a single dataset; and yields stronger domain generalization performance as well.

On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt is employed to make zero-shot predictions.~To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, context optimization \cite{zhou2021coop} has been proposed to learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training examples.~In this paper, we show that there is an alternative path to achieve better vision-language models other than prompt tuning.~While prompt tuning is for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically, CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and performs residual-style feature blending with the original pre-trained features.~As a consequence, CLIP-Adapter is able to outperform context optimization while maintains a simple design.

    abstract={Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has provided a new paradigm for learning visual representations by using large-scale contrastive image-text pairs. It shows impressive performance on zero-shot knowledge transfer to downstream tasks. To further enhance CLIP's few-shot capability, CLIP-Adapter proposed to fine-tune a lightweight residual feature adapter and significantly improves the performance for few-shot classification. However, such a process still needs extra training and computational resources. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T}raining-Free CL\textbf{IP}-\textbf{Adapter} (\textbf{Tip-Adapter}), which not only inherits CLIP's training-free advantage but also performs comparably or even better than CLIP-Adapter. Tip-Adapter does not require any back propagation for training the adapter, but creates the weights by a key-value cache model constructed from the few-shot training set. In this non-parametric manner, Tip-Adapter acquires well-performed adapter weights without any training, which is both efficient and effective. Moreover, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted by fine-tuning such properly initialized adapter for only a few epochs with super-fast convergence speed. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on ImageNet and other 10 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of proposed Tip-Adapter.

    abstract={Recent advances in contrastive representation learning over paired image-text data have led to models such as CLIP that achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification and distributional robustness. Such models typically require joint reasoning in the image and text representation spaces for downstream inference tasks. Contrary to prior beliefs, we demonstrate that the image and text representations learned via a standard contrastive objective are not interchangeable and can lead to inconsistent downstream predictions. To mitigate this issue, we formalize consistency and propose CyCLIP, a framework for contrastive representation learning that explicitly optimizes for the learned representations to be geometrically consistent in the image and text space. In particular, we show that consistent representations can be learned by explicitly symmetrizing (a) the similarity between the two mismatched image-text pairs (cross-modal consistency); and (b) the similarity between the image-image pair and the text-text pair (in-modal consistency). Empirically, we show that the improved consistency in CyCLIP translates to significant gains over CLIP, with gains ranging from 10%-24% for zero-shot classification accuracy on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet1K) and 10%-27% for robustness to various natural distribution shifts.

    abstract={Recently, zero-shot and few-shot learning via Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) have shown inspirational performance on 2D visual recognition, which learns to match images with their corresponding texts in open-vocabulary settings. However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP, pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3D recognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing PointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D category texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it into multi-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot prediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we design an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and adaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in 2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, the performance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe the complementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks. By simple ensembling, PointCLIP boosts baseline's performance and even surpasses state-of-the-art models. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promising alternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding via CLIP under low resource cost and data regime. We conduct thorough experiments on widely-adopted ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and the challenging ScanObjectNN to demonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP.

    abstract={The canonical approach to video action recognition dictates a neural model to do a classic and standard 1-of-N majority vote task. They are trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferable ability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic information of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers. Specifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a multimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with more semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action recognition without any further labeled data or parameters requirements. Moreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous web data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework for action recognition, which we dub "pre-train, prompt and fine-tune". This paradigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large amount of web image-text or video-text data. Then it makes the action recognition task to act more like pre-training problems via prompt engineering. Finally, it end-to-end fine-tunes on target datasets to obtain strong performance. We give an instantiation of the new paradigm, ActionCLIP, which not only has superior and flexible zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability but also reaches a top performance on general action recognition task, achieving 83.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with a ViT-B/16 as the backbone.

    abstract={Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.},

    abstract={The canonical approach to video-and-language learning (e.g., video question answering) dictates a neural model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features from vision models and text features from language models. These feature extractors are trained independently and usually on tasks different from the target domains, rendering these fixed features sub-optimal for downstream tasks. Moreover, due to the high computational overload of dense video features, it is often difficult (or infeasible) to plug feature extractors directly into existing approaches for easy finetuning. To provide a remedy to this dilemma, we propose a generic framework ClipBERT that enables affordable end-to-end learning for video-and-language tasks, by employing sparse sampling, where only a single or a few sparsely sampled short clips from a video are used at each training step. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that ClipBERT outperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length videos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled clips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from full-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle. Videos in the datasets are from considerably different domains and lengths, ranging from 3-second generic domain GIF videos to 180-second YouTube human activity videos, showing the generalization ability of our approach.

    abstract={Recently, large-scale pre-training methods like CLIP have made great progress in multi-modal research such as text-video retrieval. In CLIP, transformers are vital for modeling complex multi-modal relations. However, in the vision transformer of CLIP, the essential visual tokenization process, which produces discrete visual token sequences, generates many homogeneous tokens due to the redundancy nature of consecutive and similar frames in videos. This significantly increases computation costs and hinders the deployment of video retrieval models in web applications. In this paper, to reduce the number of redundant video tokens, we design a multi-segment token clustering algorithm to find the most representative tokens and drop the non-essential ones. As the frame redundancy occurs mostly in consecutive frames, we divide videos into multiple segments and conduct segment-level clustering. Center tokens from each segment are later concatenated into a new sequence, while their original spatial-temporal relations are well maintained. We instantiate two clustering algorithms to efficiently find deterministic medoids and iteratively partition groups in high dimensional space. Through this token clustering and center selection procedure, we successfully reduce computation costs by removing redundant visual tokens. This method further enhances segment-level semantic alignment between video and text representations, enforcing the spatio-temporal interactions of tokens from within-segment frames. Our method, coined as CenterCLIP, surpasses existing state-of-the-art by a large margin on typical text-video benchmarks, while reducing the training memory cost by 35\% and accelerating the inference speed by 14\% at the best case.

    abstract={Video-text retrieval has been a crucial and fundamental task in multi-modal research. The development of video-text retrieval has been considerably promoted by large-scale multi-modal contrastive pre-training, which primarily focuses on coarse-grained or fine-grained contrast. However, cross-grained contrast, which is the contrast between coarse-grained representations and fine-grained representations, has rarely been explored in prior research. Compared with fine-grained or coarse-grained contrasts, cross-grained contrast calculate the correlation between coarse-grained features and each fine-grained feature, and is able to filter out the unnecessary fine-grained features guided by the coarse-grained feature during similarity calculation, thus improving the accuracy of retrieval. To this end, this paper presents a novel multi-grained contrastive model, namely X-CLIP, for video-text retrieval. However, another challenge lies in the similarity aggregation problem, which aims to aggregate fine-grained and cross-grained similarity matrices to instance-level similarity. To address this challenge, we propose the Attention Over Similarity Matrix (AOSM) module to make the model focus on the contrast between essential frames and words, thus lowering the impact of unnecessary frames and words on retrieval results. With multi-grained contrast and the proposed AOSM module, X-CLIP achieves outstanding performance on five widely-used video-text retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT (49.3 R@1), MSVD (50.4 R@1), LSMDC (26.1 R@1), DiDeMo (47.8 R@1) and ActivityNet (46.2 R@1).

    abstract={Cross-modality interaction is a critical component in Text-Video Retrieval (TVR), yet there has been little examination of how different influencing factors for computing interaction affect performance. This paper first studies the interaction paradigm in depth, where we find that its computation can be split into two terms, the interaction contents at different granularity and the matching function to distinguish pairs with the same semantics. We also observe that the single-vector representation and implicit intensive function substantially hinder the optimization. Based on these findings, we propose a disentangled framework to capture a sequential and hierarchical representation. Firstly, considering the natural sequential structure in both text and video inputs, a Weighted Token-wise Interaction (WTI) module is performed to decouple the content and adaptively exploit the pair-wise correlations. This interaction can form a better disentangled manifold for sequential inputs. Secondly, we introduce a Channel DeCorrelation Regularization (CDCR) to minimize the redundancy between the components of the compared vectors, which facilitate learning a hierarchical representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled representation on various benchmarks, e.g., surpassing CLIP4Clip largely by +2.9%, +3.1%, +7.9%, +2.3%, +2.8% and +6.5% R@1 on the MSR-VTT, MSVD, VATEX, LSMDC, AcitivityNet, and DiDeMo, respectively.},

Collecting and annotating such a training set is thus highly expensive and unscalable. Semi-supervised TAD (SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely available at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem than supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods directly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to their sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this limitation, in this work we propose a novel Semi-supervised Temporal action detection model based on PropOsal-free Temporal mask (SPOT) with a parallel localization (mask generation) and classification architecture. Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by cutting off the route for error propagation in-between.

Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with significantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image classification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to tackle the more complex TAD task.

In this work, we explore single-frame models for video-and-language learning. On a diverse set of video-and-language tasks (including text-to-video retrieval and video question answering), we show the surprising result that, with large-scale pre-training and a proper frame ensemble strategy at inference time, a single-frame trained model that does not consider temporal information can achieve better performance than existing methods that use multiple frames for training. This result reveals the existence of a strong "static appearance bias" in popular video-and-language datasets. Therefore, to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of video-and-language models, we propose two new retrieval tasks based on existing fine-grained action recognition datasets that encourage temporal modeling.

    abstract={Recent works have shown that the computational efficiency of video recognition can be significantly improved by reducing the spatial redundancy. As a representative work, the adaptive focus method (AdaFocus) has achieved a favorable trade-off between accuracy and inference speed by dynamically identifying and attending to the informative regions in each video frame. However, AdaFocus requires a complicated three-stage training pipeline (involving reinforcement learning), leading to slow convergence and is unfriendly to practitioners. This work reformulates the training of AdaFocus as a simple one-stage algorithm by introducing a differentiable interpolation-based patch selection operation, enabling efficient end-to-end optimization. We further present an improved training scheme to address the issues introduced by the one-stage formulation, including the lack of supervision, input diversity and training stability. Moreover, a conditional-exit technique is proposed to perform temporal adaptive computation on top of AdaFocus without additional training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, and Jester) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the original AdaFocus and other competitive baselines, while being considerably more simple and efficient to train.

Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset.

    abstract={Contrastive language-image pretraining has shown great success in learning visual-textual joint representation from web-scale data, demonstrating remarkable "zero-shot" generalization ability for various image tasks. However, how to effectively expand such new language-image pretraining methods to video domains is still an open problem. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video recognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch. More concretely, to capture the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal dimension, we propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly exchanges information across frames. Such module is lightweight and can be plugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly. Moreover, we propose a video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information for generating discriminative textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective and can be generalized to different video recognition scenarios. In particular, under fully-supervised settings, our approach achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using 12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot experiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by +7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top-1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In few-shot scenarios, our approach outperforms previous best methods by +32.1% and +23.1% when the labeled data is extremely limited. Code and models are available at https://aka.ms/X-CLIP},

    abstract={Pre-training a model to learn transferable video-text representation for retrieval has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Previous dominant works mainly adopt two separate encoders for efficient retrieval, but ignore local associations between videos and texts. Another line of research uses a joint encoder to interact video with texts, but results in low efficiency since each text-video pair needs to be fed into the model. In this work, we enable fine-grained video-text interactions while maintaining high efficiency for retrieval via a novel pretext task, dubbed as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), where a parametric module BridgeFormer is trained to answer the "questions" constructed by the text features via resorting to the video features. Specifically, we exploit the rich semantics of text (i.e., nouns and verbs) to build questions, with which the video encoder can be trained to capture more regional content and temporal dynamics. In the form of questions and answers, the semantic associations between local video-text features can be properly established. BridgeFormer is able to be removed for downstream retrieval, rendering an efficient and flexible model with only two encoders. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular text-to-video retrieval task in five datasets with different experimental setups (i.e., zero-shot and fine-tune), including HowTo100M (one million videos). We further conduct zero-shot action recognition, which can be cast as video-to-text retrieval, and our approach also significantly surpasses its counterparts. As an additional benefit, our method achieves competitive results with much shorter pre-training videos on single-modality downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition with linear evaluation.},

Along with the growth of computational capacity, we now have open-source vision-language pre-trained models in large scales of the model architecture and amount of data. In this study, we focus on transferring knowledge for video classification tasks. Conventional methods randomly initialize the linear classifier head for vision classification, but they leave the usage of the text encoder for downstream visual recognition tasks undiscovered. In this paper, we revise the role of the linear classifier and replace the classifier with the different knowledge from pre-trained model. We utilize the well-pretrained language model to generate good semantic target for efficient transferring learning. The empirical study shows that our method improves both the performance and the training speed of video classification, with a negligible change in the model.

Transferring knowledge from such powerful VLMs is a promising direction for building effective video recognition models. However, current exploration in this field is still limited. We believe that the greatest value of pre-trained VLMs lies in building a bridge between visual and textual domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called BIKE, which utilizes the cross-modal bridge to explore bidirectional knowledge: i) We introduce the Video Attribute Association mechanism, which leverages the Video-to-Text knowledge to generate textual auxiliary attributes for complementing video recognition. ii) We also present a Temporal Concept Spotting mechanism that uses the Text-to-Video expertise to capture temporal saliency in a parameter-free manner, leading to enhanced video representation.

    abstract={Modern image captioning models are usually trained with text similarity objectives. However, since reference captions in public datasets often describe the most salient common objects, models trained with text similarity objectives tend to ignore specific and detailed aspects of an image that distinguish it from others. Toward more descriptive and distinctive caption generation, we propose using CLIP, a multimodal encoder trained on huge image-text pairs from web, to calculate multimodal similarity and use it as a reward function. We also propose a simple finetuning strategy of the CLIP text encoder to improve grammar that does not require extra text annotation. This completely eliminates the need for reference captions during the reward computation. To comprehensively evaluate descriptive captions, we introduce FineCapEval, a new dataset for caption evaluation with fine-grained criteria: overall, background, object, relations. In our experiments on text-to-image retrieval and FineCapEval, the proposed CLIP-guided model generates more distinctive captions than the CIDEr-optimized model. We also show that our unsupervised grammar finetuning of the CLIP text encoder alleviates the degeneration problem of the naive CLIP reward. Lastly, we show human analysis where the annotators strongly prefer the CLIP reward to the CIDEr and MLE objectives according to various criteria.

    abstract={Image captioning is a fundamental task in vision-language understanding, where the model predicts a textual informative caption to a given input image. In this paper, we present a simple approach to address this task. We use CLIP encoding as a prefix to the caption, by employing a simple mapping network, and then fine-tunes a language model to generate the image captions. The recently proposed CLIP model contains rich semantic features which were trained with textual context, making it best for vision-language perception. Our key idea is that together with a pre-trained language model (GPT2), we obtain a wide understanding of both visual and textual data. Hence, our approach only requires rather quick training to produce a competent captioning model. Without additional annotations or pre-training, it efficiently generates meaningful captions for large-scale and diverse datasets. Surprisingly, our method works well even when only the mapping network is trained, while both CLIP and the language model remain frozen, allowing a lighter architecture with less trainable parameters. Through quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate our model achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on the challenging Conceptual Captions and nocaps datasets, while it is simpler, faster, and lighter.

It is costly to further scale up the number of classes contained in existing object detection datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose ViLD, a training method via Vision and Language knowledge Distillation. Our method distills the knowledge from a pretrained open-vocabulary image classification model (teacher) into a two-stage detector (student). Specifically, we use the teacher model to encode category texts and image regions of object proposals. Then we train a student detector, whose region embeddings of detected boxes are aligned with the text and image embeddings inferred by the teacher. We benchmark on LVIS by holding out all rare categories as novel categories that are not seen during training. ViLD obtains 16.1 mask AP$_r$ with a ResNet-50 backbone, even outperforming the supervised counterpart by 3.8. When trained with a stronger teacher model ALIGN, ViLD achieves 26.3 AP$_r$. The model can directly transfer to other datasets without finetuning, achieving 72.2 AP$_{50}$ on PASCAL VOC, 36.6 AP on COCO and 11.8 AP on Objects365.

Unlike prior work, Detic does not need complex assignment schemes to assign image labels to boxes based on model predictions, making it much easier to implement and compatible with a range of detection architectures and backbones. Our results show that Detic yields excellent detectors even for classes without box annotations. It outperforms prior work on both open-vocabulary and long-tail detection benchmarks. Detic provides a gain of 2.4 mAP for all classes and 8.3 mAP for novel classes on the open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark. On the standard LVIS benchmark, Detic obtains 41.7 mAP when evaluated on all classes, or only rare classes, hence closing the gap in performance for object categories with few samples.

While early concurrent works have begun to study this potential on a subset of tasks, important questions remain: 1) What is the benefit of CLIP on unstudied VL tasks? 2) Does CLIP provide benefit in low-shot or domain-shifted scenarios? 3) Can CLIP improve existing approaches without impacting inference or pretraining complexity? In this work, we seek to answer these questions through two key contributions. First, we introduce an evaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of data availability constraints and conditions of domain shift. Second, we propose an approach, named CLIP Targeted Distillation (CLIP-TD), to intelligently distill knowledge from CLIP into existing architectures using a dynamically weighted objective applied to adaptively selected tokens per instance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed CLIP-TD leads to exceptional gains in the low-shot (up to 51.9%) and domain-shifted (up to 71.3%) conditions of VCR, while simultaneously improving performance under standard fully-supervised conditions (up to 2%), achieving state-of-art performance on VCR compared to other single models that are pretrained with image-text data only. On SNLI-VE, CLIP-TD produces significant gains in low-shot conditions (up to 6.6%) as well as fully supervised (up to 3%). On VQA, CLIP-TD provides improvement in low-shot (up to 9%), and in fully-supervised (up to 1.3%).

We present ReCLIP, a simple but strong zero-shot baseline that repurposes CLIP, a state-of-the-art large-scale model, for ReC. Motivated by the close connection between ReC and CLIP's contrastive pre-training objective, the first component of ReCLIP is a region-scoring method that isolates object proposals via cropping and blurring, and passes them to CLIP. However, through controlled experiments on a synthetic dataset, we find that CLIP is largely incapable of performing spatial reasoning off-the-shelf. Thus, the second component of ReCLIP is a spatial relation resolver that handles several types of spatial relations. We reduce the gap between zero-shot baselines from prior work and supervised models by as much as 29% on RefCOCOg, and on RefGTA (video game imagery), ReCLIP's relative improvement over supervised ReC models trained on real images is 8%.},

Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-the-art pretrained language models. We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably well on open-domain question answering against a supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are learned much more readily than others by standard language model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as unsupervised open-domain QA systems. The code to reproduce our analysis is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LAMA.},

Inspired by priming methods in human psychology, we add "misprimes" to cloze questions ("Talk? Birds can [MASK]"). We find that PLMs are easily distracted by misprimes.

    author={Taylor Shin and Yasaman Razeghi and Robert L. Logan IV and Eric Wallace and Sameer Singh},
    abstract={The remarkable success of pretrained language models has motivated the study of what kinds of knowledge these models learn during pretraining. Reformulating tasks as fill-in-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge, however, its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. To address this, we develop AutoPrompt, an automated method to create prompts for a diverse set of tasks, based on a gradient-guided search. Using AutoPrompt, we show that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning, sometimes achieving performance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark, and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that automatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods, and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable, potentially a replacement for finetuning.},

    abstract={Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.   The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU.

When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

    abstract={We present Mobile Video Networks (MoViNets), a family of computation and memory efficient video networks that can operate on streaming video for online inference. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are accurate at video recognition but require large computation and memory budgets and do not support online inference, making them difficult to work on mobile devices. We propose a three-step approach to improve computational efficiency while substantially reducing the peak memory usage of 3D CNNs. First, we design a video network search space and employ neural architecture search to generate efficient and diverse 3D CNN architectures. Second, we introduce the Stream Buffer technique that decouples memory from video clip duration, allowing 3D CNNs to embed arbitrary-length streaming video sequences for both training and inference with a small constant memory footprint. Third, we propose a simple ensembling technique to improve accuracy further without sacrificing efficiency. These three progressive techniques allow MoViNets to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on the Kinetics, Moments in Time, and Charades video action recognition datasets. For instance, MoViNet-A5-Stream achieves the same accuracy as X3D-XL on Kinetics 600 while requiring 80% fewer FLOPs and 65% less memory.

    abstract={Large pre-trained models such as CLIP or ALIGN offer consistent accuracy across a range of data distributions when performing zero-shot inference (i.e., without fine-tuning on a specific dataset). Although existing fine-tuning methods substantially improve accuracy on a given target distribution, they often reduce robustness to distribution shifts. We address this tension by introducing a simple and effective method for improving robustness while fine-tuning: ensembling the weights of the zero-shot and fine-tuned models (WiSE-FT). Compared to standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT provides large accuracy improvements under distribution shift, while preserving high accuracy on the target distribution. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, WiSE-FT improves accuracy under distribution shift by 4 to 6 percentage points (pp) over prior work while increasing ImageNet accuracy by 1.6 pp. WiSE-FT achieves similarly large robustness gains (2 to 23 pp) on a diverse set of six further distribution shifts, and accuracy gains of 0.8 to 3.3 pp compared to standard fine-tuning on seven commonly used transfer learning datasets. These improvements come at no additional computational cost during fine-tuning or inference.},

    abstract={Training large-scale image recognition models is computationally expensive. This raises the question of whether there might be simple ways to improve the test performance of an already trained model without having to re-train or fine-tune it with new data. Here, we show that, surprisingly, this is indeed possible. The key observation we make is that the layers of a deep network close to the output layer contain independent, easily extractable class-relevant information that is not contained in the output layer itself. We propose to extract this extra class-relevant information using a simple key-value cache memory to improve the classification performance of the model at test time. Our cache memory is directly inspired by a similar cache model previously proposed for language modeling (Grave et al., 2017). This cache component does not require any training or fine-tuning; it can be applied to any pre-trained model and, by properly setting only two hyper-parameters, leads to significant improvements in its classification performance. Improvements are observed across several architectures and datasets. In the cache component, using features extracted from layers close to the output (but not from the output layer itself) as keys leads to the largest improvements. Concatenating features from multiple layers to form keys can further improve performance over using single-layer features as keys. The cache component also has a regularizing effect, a simple consequence of which is that it substantially increases the robustness of models against adversarial attacks.},

    abstract={Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But recent deep learning object detectors have avoided pyramid representations, in part because they are compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using FPN in a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

    abstract={Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

In THUMOS 2014, we elevated action recognition to a more practical level by introducing temporally untrimmed videos. These also include `background videos' which share similar scenes and backgrounds as action videos, but are devoid of the specific actions.

    abstract={As soon as abstract mathematical computations were adapted to computation on digital computers, the problem of efficient representation, manipulation, and communication of the numerical values in those computations arose. Strongly related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas. Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations associated with Neural Networks. In this article, we survey approaches to the problem of quantizing the numerical values in deep Neural Network computations, covering the advantages/disadvantages of current methods. With this survey and its organization, we hope to have presented a useful snapshot of the current research in quantization for Neural Networks and to have given an intelligent organization to ease the evaluation of future research in this area.},

As a more scalable alternative, we introduce Prismer, a data- and parameter-efficient vision-language model that leverages an ensemble of domain experts. Prismer only requires training of a small number of components, with the majority of network weights inherited from readily-available, pre-trained domain experts, and kept frozen during training. By leveraging experts from a wide range of domains, we show that Prismer can efficiently pool this expert knowledge and adapt it to various vision-language reasoning tasks. In our experiments, we show that Prismer achieves fine-tuned and few-shot learning performance which is competitive with current state-of-the-art models, whilst requiring up to two orders of magnitude less training data.

    abstract={In this work we introduce a fully end-to-end approach for action detection in videos that learns to directly predict the temporal bounds of actions. Our intuition is that the process of detecting actions is naturally one of observation and refinement: observing moments in video, and refining hypotheses about when an action is occurring. Based on this insight, we formulate our model as a recurrent neural network-based agent that interacts with a video over time. The agent observes video frames and decides both where to look next and when to emit a prediction. Since backpropagation is not adequate in this non-differentiable setting, we use REINFORCE to learn the agent's decision policy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet datasets while observing only a fraction (2% or less) of the video frames.},

This unique design enables our TSN to efficiently learn action models by using the whole action videos.

    abstract={Temporal action proposal generation is an important yet challenging problem, since temporal proposals with rich action content are indispensable for analysing real-world videos with long duration and high proportion irrelevant content. This problem requires methods not only generating proposals with precise temporal boundaries, but also retrieving proposals to cover truth action instances with high recall and high overlap using relatively fewer proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce an effective proposal generation method, named Boundary-Sensitive Network (BSN), which adopts "local to global" fashion. Locally, BSN first locates temporal boundaries with high probabilities, then directly combines these boundaries as proposals. Globally, with Boundary-Sensitive Proposal feature, BSN retrieves proposals by evaluating the confidence of whether a proposal contains an action within its region. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, where BSN outperforms other state-of-the-art temporal action proposal generation methods with high recall and high temporal precision.

    abstract={Temporal action proposal generation is an important task, akin to object proposals, temporal action proposals are intended to capture "clips" or temporal intervals in videos that are likely to contain an action. Previous methods can be divided to two groups: sliding window ranking and actionness score grouping. Sliding windows uniformly cover all segments in videos, but the temporal boundaries are imprecise; grouping based method may have more precise boundaries but it may omit some proposals when the quality of actionness score is low. Based on the complementary characteristics of these two methods, we propose a novel Complementary Temporal Action Proposal (CTAP) generator. Specifically, we apply a Proposal-level Actionness Trustworthiness Estimator (PATE) on the sliding windows proposals to generate the probabilities indicating whether the actions can be correctly detected by actionness scores, the windows with high scores are collected. The collected sliding windows and actionness proposals are then processed by a temporal convolutional neural network for proposal ranking and boundary adjustment. CTAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average recall (AR) by a large margin on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet 1.3 datasets.

    abstract={The explosive growth in video streaming gives rise to challenges on performing video understanding at high accuracy and low computation cost. Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot capture temporal relationships; 3D CNN based methods can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive, making it expensive to deploy. In this paper, we propose a generic and effective Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that enjoys both high efficiency and high performance. Specifically, it can achieve the performance of 3D CNN but maintain 2D CNN's complexity. TSM shifts part of the channels along the temporal dimension; thus facilitate information exchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve temporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. We also extended TSM to online setting, which enables real-time low-latency online video recognition and video object detection. TSM is accurate and efficient: it ranks the first place on the Something-Something leaderboard upon publication; on Jetson Nano and Galaxy Note8, it achieves a low latency of 13ms and 35ms for online video recognition.

In this work, we present YOWO, a unified CNN architecture for real-time spatiotemporal action localization in video streams.

Five objectives, including video-text joint, conditioned masked language model (CMLM), conditioned masked frame model (CMFM), video-text alignment, and language reconstruction, are designed to train each of the components. We further develop two pre-training strategies, stage by stage pre-training (StagedP) and enhanced video representation (EnhancedV), to make the training process of the UniVL more effective.

    abstract={In this paper, we study an intermediate form of supervision, i.e., single-frame supervision, for temporal action localization (TAL). To obtain the single-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single frame within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce the labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the action boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the video-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal action signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of such single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net. First, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along with a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive information about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal boundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and background frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo action frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its nearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the unannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth labeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the classifier. In extensive experiments on THUMOS14, GTEA, and BEOID, SF-Net significantly improves upon state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods in terms of both segment localization and single-frame localization. Notably, SF-Net achieves comparable results to its fully-supervised counterpart which requires much more resource intensive annotations.

    abstract={Temporal modeling is key for action recognition in videos. It normally considers both short-range motions and long-range aggregations. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Excitation and Aggregation (TEA) block, including a motion excitation (ME) module and a multiple temporal aggregation (MTA) module, specifically designed to capture both short- and long-range temporal evolution. In particular, for short-range motion modeling, the ME module calculates the feature-level temporal differences from spatiotemporal features. It then utilizes the differences to excite the motion-sensitive channels of the features. The long-range temporal aggregations in previous works are typically achieved by stacking a large number of local temporal convolutions. Each convolution processes a local temporal window at a time. In contrast, the MTA module proposes to deform the local convolution to a group of sub-convolutions, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing additional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of sub-convolutions, and each frame could complete multiple temporal aggregations with neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive field of temporal dimension is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of modeling the long-range temporal relationship over distant frames. The two components of the TEA block are complementary in temporal modeling. Finally, our approach achieves impressive results at low FLOPs on several action recognition benchmarks, such as Kinetics, Something-Something, HMDB51, and UCF101, which confirms its effectiveness and efficiency.},

TAM proposes a unique two-level adaptive modeling scheme by decoupling the dynamic kernel into a location sensitive importance map and a location invariant aggregation weight. The importance map is learned in a local temporal window to capture short-term information, while the aggregation weight is generated from a global view with a focus on long-term structure.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a concise and novel SmallBig network, with the cooperation of small and big views. For the current time step, the small view branch is used to learn the core semantics, while the big view branch is used to capture the contextual semantics. Unlike traditional temporal convolution, the big view branch can provide the small view branch with the most activated video features from a broader 3D receptive field. Via aggregating such big-view contexts, the small view branch can learn more robust and discriminative spatio-temporal representations for video classification. Furthermore, we propose to share convolution in the small and big view branch, which improves model compactness as well as alleviates overfitting. As a result, our SmallBigNet achieves a comparable model size like 2D CNNs, while boosting accuracy like 3D CNNs.

Current methods often suffer from the noisy boundary locations and the inferior quality of confidence scores used for proposal retrieving. In this paper, we present BSN++, a new framework which exploits complementary boundary regressor and relation modeling for temporal proposal generation. First, we propose a novel boundary regressor based on the complementary characteristics of both starting and ending boundary classifiers. Specifically, we utilize the U-shaped architecture with nested skip connections to capture rich contexts and introduce bi-directional boundary matching mechanism to improve boundary precision. Second, to account for the proposal-proposal relations ignored in previous methods, we devise a proposal relation block to which includes two self-attention modules from the aspects of position and channel. Furthermore, we find that there inevitably exists data imbalanced problems in the positive/negative proposals and temporal durations, which harm the model performance on tail distributions. To relieve this issue, we introduce the scale-balanced re-sampling strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular benchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, which demonstrate that BSN++ achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Extensive experiments show that using features trained with our novel pretraining strategy significantly improves the performance of recent state-of-the-art methods on three tasks: Temporal Action Localization, Action Proposal Generation, and Dense Video Captioning.

As a minor contribution, we present a simple baseline approach for handling the intra-instance variations, which reports an mAP of 18.9% on MUSES and 56.9% on THUMOS14 at IoU=0.5. To facilitate research in this direction, we release the dataset and the project code at https://songbai.site/muses/ .},

    url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10071v2},
    author={Limin Wang and Zhan Tong and Bin Ji and Gangshan Wu},
    abstract={Temporal modeling still remains challenging for action recognition in videos. To mitigate this issue, this paper presents a new video architecture, termed as Temporal Difference Network (TDN), with a focus on capturing multi-scale temporal information for efficient action recognition. The core of our TDN is to devise an efficient temporal module (TDM) by explicitly leveraging a temporal difference operator, and systematically assess its effect on short-term and long-term motion modeling. To fully capture temporal information over the entire video, our TDN is established with a two-level difference modeling paradigm. Specifically, for local motion modeling, temporal difference over consecutive frames is used to supply 2D CNNs with finer motion pattern, while for global motion modeling, temporal difference across segments is incorporated to capture long-range structure for motion feature excitation. TDN provides a simple and principled temporal modeling framework and could be instantiated with the existing CNNs at a small extra computational cost. Our TDN presents a new state of the art on the Something-Something V1 & V2 datasets and is on par with the best performance on the Kinetics-400 dataset. In addition, we conduct in-depth ablation studies and plot the visualization results of our TDN, hopefully providing insightful analysis on temporal difference modeling. We release the code at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/TDN.},

    author={Jing Tan and Jiaqi Tang and Limin Wang and Gangshan Wu},
    abstract={Temporal action proposal generation is an important and challenging task in video understanding, which aims at detecting all temporal segments containing action instances of interest. The existing proposal generation approaches are generally based on pre-defined anchor windows or heuristic bottom-up boundary matching strategies. This paper presents a simple and efficient framework (RTD-Net) for direct action proposal generation, by re-purposing a Transformer-alike architecture. To tackle the essential visual difference between time and space, we make three important improvements over the original transformer detection framework (DETR). First, to deal with slowness prior in videos, we replace the original Transformer encoder with a boundary attentive module to better capture long-range temporal information. Second, due to the ambiguous temporal boundary and relatively sparse annotations, we present a relaxed matching scheme to relieve the strict criteria of single assignment to each groundtruth. Finally, we devise a three-branch head to further improve the proposal confidence estimation by explicitly predicting its completeness. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RTD-Net, on both tasks of temporal action proposal generation and temporal action detection. Moreover, due to its simplicity in design, our framework is more efficient than previous proposal generation methods, without non-maximum suppression post-processing.

    abstract={Temporal action localization is an important yet challenging task in video understanding. Typically, such a task aims at inferring both the action category and localization of the start and end frame for each action instance in a long, untrimmed video.While most current models achieve good results by using pre-defined anchors and numerous actionness, such methods could be bothered with both large number of outputs and heavy tuning of locations and sizes corresponding to different anchors. Instead, anchor-free methods is lighter, getting rid of redundant hyper-parameters, but gains few attention. In this paper, we propose the first purely anchor-free temporal localization method, which is both efficient and effective. Our model includes (i) an end-to-end trainable basic predictor, (ii) a saliency-based refinement module to gather more valuable boundary features for each proposal with a novel boundary pooling, and (iii) several consistency constraints to make sure our model can find the accurate boundary given arbitrary proposals. Extensive experiments show that our method beats all anchor-based and actionness-guided methods with a remarkable margin on THUMOS14, achieving state-of-the-art results, and comparable ones on ActivityNet v1.3.

    abstract={Temporal action proposal generation aims to estimate temporal intervals of actions in untrimmed videos, which is a challenging yet important task in the video understanding field. The proposals generated by current methods still suffer from inaccurate temporal boundaries and inferior confidence used for retrieval owing to the lack of efficient temporal modeling and effective boundary context utilization. In this paper, we propose Temporal Context Aggregation Network (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals through "local and global" temporal context aggregation and complementary as well as progressive boundary refinement. Specifically, we first design a Local-Global Temporal Encoder (LGTE), which adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" temporal inter-dependencies. Furthermore, both the boundary and internal context of proposals are adopted for frame-level and segment-level boundary regressions, respectively. Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is designed to combine these two regression granularities in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves the precise boundaries and reliable confidence of proposals through progressive refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets: HACS, ActivityNet-v1.3, and THUMOS-14, where TCANet can generate proposals with high precision and recall. By combining with the existing action classifier, TCANet can obtain remarkable temporal action detection performance compared with other methods. Not surprisingly, the proposed TCANet won the 1$^{st}$ place in the CVPR 2020 - HACS challenge leaderboard on temporal action localization task.},

    author={Can Zhang and Meng Cao and Dongming Yang and Jie Chen and Yuexian Zou},
    abstract={Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing models follow the "localization by classification" procedure: locate temporal regions contributing most to the video-level classification. Generally, they process each snippet (or frame) individually and thus overlook the fruitful temporal context relation. Here arises the single snippet cheating issue: "hard" snippets are too vague to be classified. In this paper, we argue that learning by comparing helps identify these hard snippets and we propose to utilize snippet Contrastive learning to Localize Actions, CoLA for short. Specifically, we propose a Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss to refine the hard snippet representation in feature space, which guides the network to perceive precise temporal boundaries and avoid the temporal interval interruption. Besides, since it is infeasible to access frame-level annotations, we introduce a Hard Snippet Mining algorithm to locate the potential hard snippets. Substantial analyses verify that this mining strategy efficaciously captures the hard snippets and SniCo Loss leads to more informative feature representation. Extensive experiments show that CoLA achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet v1.2 datasets. CoLA code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhang-can/CoLA.},

    abstract={Self-supervised learning presents a remarkable performance to utilize unlabeled data for various video tasks. In this paper, we focus on applying the power of self-supervised methods to improve semi-supervised action proposal generation. Particularly, we design an effective Self-supervised Semi-supervised Temporal Action Proposal (SSTAP) framework. The SSTAP contains two crucial branches, i.e., temporal-aware semi-supervised branch and relation-aware self-supervised branch. The semi-supervised branch improves the proposal model by introducing two temporal perturbations, i.e., temporal feature shift and temporal feature flip, in the mean teacher framework. The self-supervised branch defines two pretext tasks, including masked feature reconstruction and clip-order prediction, to learn the relation of temporal clues. By this means, SSTAP can better explore unlabeled videos, and improve the discriminative abilities of learned action features. We extensively evaluate the proposed SSTAP on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that SSTAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and even matches fully-supervised methods.

    abstract={Temporal action detection (TAD) aims to determine the semantic label and the temporal interval of every action instance in an untrimmed video. It is a fundamental and challenging task in video understanding. Previous methods tackle this task with complicated pipelines. They often need to train multiple networks and involve hand-designed operations, such as non-maximal suppression and anchor generation, which limit the flexibility and prevent end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Transformer-based method for TAD, termed TadTR. Given a small set of learnable embeddings called action queries, TadTR adaptively extracts temporal context information from the video for each query and directly predicts action instances with the context. To adapt Transformer to TAD, we propose three improvements to enhance its locality awareness. The core is a temporal deformable attention module that selectively attends to a sparse set of key snippets in a video. A segment refinement mechanism and an actionness regression head are designed to refine the boundaries and confidence of the predicted instances, respectively. With such a simple pipeline, TadTR requires lower computation cost than previous detectors, while preserving remarkable performance. As a self-contained detector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 (56.7% mAP) and HACS Segments (32.09% mAP). Combined with an extra action classifier, it obtains 36.75% mAP on ActivityNet-1.3. Code is available at https://github.com/xlliu7/TadTR.},

    author={Pilhyeon Lee and Hyeran Byun},
    abstract={We tackle the problem of localizing temporal intervals of actions with only a single frame label for each action instance for training. Owing to label sparsity, existing work fails to learn action completeness, resulting in fragmentary action predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, where dense pseudo-labels are generated to provide completeness guidance for the model. Concretely, we first select pseudo background points to supplement point-level action labels. Then, by taking the points as seeds, we search for the optimal sequence that is likely to contain complete action instances while agreeing with the seeds. To learn completeness from the obtained sequence, we introduce two novel losses that contrast action instances with background ones in terms of action score and feature similarity, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our completeness guidance indeed helps the model to locate complete action instances, leading to large performance gains especially under high IoU thresholds. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks: THUMOS'14, GTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet. Notably, our method even performs comparably to recent fully-supervised methods, at the 6 times cheaper annotation cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pilhyeon.},

    abstract={Humans typically perceive the establishment of an action in a video through the interaction between an actor and the surrounding environment. An action only starts when the main actor in the video begins to interact with the environment, while it ends when the main actor stops the interaction. Despite the great progress in temporal action proposal generation, most existing works ignore the aforementioned fact and leave their model learning to propose actions as a black-box. In this paper, we make an attempt to simulate that ability of a human by proposing Actor Environment Interaction (AEI) network to improve the video representation for temporal action proposals generation. AEI contains two modules, i.e., perception-based visual representation (PVR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). PVR represents each video snippet by taking human-human relations and humans-environment relations into consideration using the proposed adaptive attention mechanism. Then, the video representation is taken by BMM to generate action proposals. AEI is comprehensively evaluated in ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets, on temporal action proposal and detection tasks, with two boundary-matching architectures (i.e., CNN-based and GCN-based) and two classifiers (i.e., Unet and P-GCN). Our AEI robustly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both temporal action proposal generation and temporal action detection.},

    author={Guo Chen and Yin-Dong Zheng and Limin Wang and Tong Lu},
    abstract={Temporal action detection aims to locate the boundaries of action in the video. The current method based on boundary matching enumerates and calculates all possible boundary matchings to generate proposals. However, these methods neglect the long-range context aggregation in boundary prediction. At the same time, due to the similar semantics of adjacent matchings, local semantic aggregation of densely-generated matchings cannot improve semantic richness and discrimination. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end proposal generation method named Dual Context Aggregation Network (DCAN) to aggregate context on two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Inspired by this success, we investigate the application of Transformer networks for temporal action localization in videos. To this end, we present ActionFormer -- a simple yet powerful model to identify actions in time and recognize their categories in a single shot, without using action proposals or relying on pre-defined anchor windows. ActionFormer combines a multiscale feature representation with local self-attention, and uses a light-weighted decoder to classify every moment in time and estimate the corresponding action boundaries. We show that this orchestrated design results in major improvements upon prior works. Without bells and whistles, ActionFormer achieves 71.0% mAP at tIoU=0.5 on THUMOS14, outperforming the best prior model by 14.1 absolute percentage points. Further, ActionFormer demonstrates strong results on ActivityNet 1.3 (36.6% average mAP) and EPIC-Kitchens 100 (+13.5% average mAP over prior works).

    abstract={Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to recognize and localize action segments in untrimmed videos given only video-level action labels for training. Without the boundary information of action segments, existing methods mostly rely on multiple instance learning (MIL), where the predictions of unlabeled instances (i.e., video snippets) are supervised by classifying labeled bags (i.e., untrimmed videos). However, this formulation typically treats snippets in a video as independent instances, ignoring the underlying temporal structures within and across action segments. To address this problem, we propose \system, a novel WTAL framework that enables explicit, action-aware segment modeling beyond standard MIL-based methods. Our framework entails three segment-centric components: (i) dynamic segment sampling for compensating the contribution of short actions; (ii) intra- and inter-segment attention for modeling action dynamics and capturing temporal dependencies; (iii) pseudo instance-level supervision for improving action boundary prediction. Furthermore, a multi-step refinement strategy is proposed to progressively improve action proposals along the model training process. Extensive experiments on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing new state of the art on both datasets.

    author={Feng Cheng and Gedas Bertasius},
    abstract={Most modern approaches in temporal action localization divide this problem into two parts: (i) short-term feature extraction and (ii) long-range temporal boundary localization. Due to the high GPU memory cost caused by processing long untrimmed videos, many methods sacrifice the representational power of the short-term feature extractor by either freezing the backbone or using a small spatial video resolution. This issue becomes even worse with the recent video transformer models, many of which have quadratic memory complexity. To address these issues, we propose TALLFormer, a memory-efficient and end-to-end trainable Temporal Action Localization Transformer with Long-term memory. Our long-term memory mechanism eliminates the need for processing hundreds of redundant video frames during each training iteration, thus, significantly reducing the GPU memory consumption and training time. These efficiency savings allow us (i) to use a powerful video transformer feature extractor without freezing the backbone or reducing the spatial video resolution, while (ii) also maintaining long-range temporal boundary localization capability. With only RGB frames as input and no external action recognition classifier, TALLFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin, achieving an average mAP of 59.1% on THUMOS14 and 35.6% on ActivityNet-1.3.

    abstract={Temporal action detection (TAD) is an important yet challenging task in video understanding. It aims to simultaneously predict the semantic label and the temporal interval of every action instance in an untrimmed video. Rather than end-to-end learning, most existing methods adopt a head-only learning paradigm, where the video encoder is pre-trained for action classification, and only the detection head upon the encoder is optimized for TAD. The effect of end-to-end learning is not systematically evaluated. Besides, there lacks an in-depth study on the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in end-to-end TAD. In this paper, we present an empirical study of end-to-end temporal action detection. We validate the advantage of end-to-end learning over head-only learning and observe up to 11\% performance improvement. Besides, we study the effects of multiple design choices that affect the TAD performance and speed, including detection head, video encoder, and resolution of input videos. Based on the findings, we build a mid-resolution baseline detector, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance of end-to-end methods while running more than 4$\times$ faster.
